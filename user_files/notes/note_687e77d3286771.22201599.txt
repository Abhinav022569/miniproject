> Create a visually appealing, responsive index page for a project called "NoteXchange – Online Notes Sharing System". This page is targeted at unregistered visitors and should explain the features and benefits of the platform. Each major feature must have its own dedicated section. The sections should be:
>
> 1. **Hero Section**: A modern banner introducing "NoteXchange", a free online note-sharing platform for students and educators. Include a call-to-action (CTA) button: “Register Now” and “Explore Features”.
>
> 2. **About the Platform**: Brief intro to what NoteXchange is — a centralized platform to upload, download, and manage study materials with group collaboration.
>
> 3. **Features Section** (use icons and cards for visual appeal):
>
>    * Easy Note Sharing (Upload/Download Notes)
>    * Study Group Creation & Management
>    * Group Chat & Messaging
>    * To-Do Lists for Academic Planning
>    * User Reputation System
>    * Admin Moderation & Announcements
>    * Secure and Accessible Anytime, Anywhere
>
> 4. **Comparison with Existing Systems**: A section (possibly as a table or infographic) showing how NoteXchange improves upon WhatsApp, Google Classroom, etc. (e.g., better organization, version control, contributor tracking, etc.)
>
> 5. **Screenshots or Demo Previews** (use placeholder images if needed): Highlight UI elements like dashboard, group chat, note uploading.
>
> 6. **Testimonials or Use Cases**: Add 2–3 example quotes from fictional users like students or teachers talking about how the platform helps them.
>
> 7. **FAQ Section**: Common questions like “Is it free?”, “Can I create my own group?”, “How is my data protected?”
>
> 8. **Call to Action**: Strong section prompting users to sign up, with a "Register Now" button and "Log in if you already have an account".
>
> 9. **Footer**: Include About Us, Contact Email, Privacy Policy, and Social Links.
>
> Use clean modern UI design (like Tailwind, Bootstrap, or Material). Use light tones with accent colors for CTA buttons. No login/register form on this page—only links to those pages.
